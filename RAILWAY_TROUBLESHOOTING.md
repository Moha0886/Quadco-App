# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## ‚úÖ FIXED: Container Restart Loop Issue

### Problem
Your Railway deployment was experiencing:
- Next.js starting successfully on port 8080
- Container immediately stopping with SIGTERM
- Continuous restart loop
- npm error: signal SIGTERM

### Root Causes & Solutions Applied

#### 1. ‚úÖ Port Configuration Issue
**Problem**: Railway expects apps to use the `PORT` environment variable
**Solution**: Updated `package.json` start script:
```json
"start": "next start -p ${PORT:-3000}"
```

#### 2. ‚úÖ Next.js Configuration for Railway
**Problem**: Next.js wasn't configured for Railway's container environment
**Solution**: Updated `next.config.ts` with:
- `output: 'standalone'` for better container deployment
- Proper environment variable handling
- Prisma external package configuration

#### 3. ‚úÖ Railway Configuration
**Problem**: Missing healthcheck and proper environment setup
**Solution**: Enhanced `railway.json` with:
- Healthcheck endpoint (`/api/test`)
- Proper environment variables
- NPM configuration for Railway

#### 4. ‚úÖ Startup Script
**Problem**: No proper startup handling
**Solution**: Added `start.sh` script for better container startup

## Current Status After Fixes

### ‚úÖ What Should Happen Now:
1. Railway will pull the latest code
2. Build will complete successfully 
3. Container will start and stay running
4. App will be accessible at your Railway URL
5. No more restart loops

### üîç Check Your Railway Dashboard:
- Build logs should show successful completion
- Container should stay in "Running" state
- You should get a stable URL
- Healthcheck at `/api/test` should pass

### üöÄ Next Steps:
1. **Wait for new deployment** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Check Railway dashboard** - container should stay running
3. **Test your URL** - should respond without restart loops
4. **Setup database** using the railway-setup.sh script
5. **Test all endpoints**

## If Still Having Issues:

### Check Environment Variables in Railway:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[your-postgres-connection]
NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=1d11c78bf8ecf66b9eb6082cf53d77b51c9ec4dff0012d905e25c7b3209df9df
PORT=8080  # Railway will set this automatically
```

### Alternative Start Commands:
If the current fix doesn't work, try these in Railway settings:
```bash
# Option 1 (current)
npm start

# Option 2 (alternative)
./start.sh

# Option 3 (direct)
npx next start -p $PORT
```

### Debugging Commands:
Use Railway's terminal to check:
```bash
# Check if Next.js builds correctly
npm run build

# Check if start works
npm start

# Check environment
env | grep -E "(PORT|DATABASE_URL|NODE_ENV)"
```

## Expected Result:
Your app should now deploy successfully and remain stable without restart loops!
