3. Click on the main service (not PostgreSQL)
4. Click "Terminal" or "Console" tab

### **Step 2: Run Database Setup Commands**
Copy and paste these **one by one** (wait for each to complete):

```bash
npx prisma generate
```
*Creates the database client*

```bash
npx prisma db push
```
*Creates all database tables*

```bash
npm run seed
```
*Adds initial data (roles, permissions, etc.)*

```bash
npx tsx scripts/create-super-admin.ts
```
*Creates your admin user*

### **Step 3: Expected Output**
You should see:
```

```

### **Step 4: Test Your App**

**Login with:**
