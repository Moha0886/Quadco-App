# 🔧 VERCEL SSO TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## 🎯 CURRENT ISSUE
Your Vercel app is deployed successfully but shows:
**"Authentication Required"** (401 error)

This means Vercel has some form of access protection enabled.

## 📋 SOLUTION STEPS

### **Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Login with your account (moha0886)

2. **Find Your Project:**
   - Look for: `quadco-app`
   - Click on it to open project details

3. **Check Security Settings:**
   Navigate to **Settings** → Look for any of these sections:
   - 🔍 **"Security"**
   - 🔍 **"Password Protection"** 
   - 🔍 **"Deployment Protection"**
   - 🔍 **"Access Control"**
   - 🔍 **"Authentication"**

4. **Disable Protection:**
   - Turn OFF any password protection
   - Turn OFF any authentication requirements
   - Set deployment protection to "None"

### **Method 2: Team Settings (If in Team)**

If you're part of a team/organization:
1. Go to **Team Settings**
2. Look for **"Security"** or **"Access Control"**
3. Disable any organization-wide authentication requirements

### **Method 3: Project-Level Settings**

In your project settings, check:
1. **General** → **Deployment Protection**: Should be "None"
2. **Security** → **Password Protection**: Should be "Disabled"
3. **Functions** → No authentication middleware enabled

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES

### **Issue A: Team/Organization SSO**
- Your account might be part of a team with mandatory SSO
- **Solution**: Ask team admin to disable SSO for this project

### **Issue B: Vercel Pro Plan Protection**
- Some Vercel plans have automatic protection features
- **Solution**: Disable in Security settings

### **Issue C: Hidden Protection Settings**
- Sometimes protection is enabled but not visible
- **Solution**: Try redeploying after checking all settings

## 🔄 AFTER DISABLING PROTECTION

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for changes to propagate
2. **Test your app**: https://quadco-app-moha0886s-projects.vercel.app
3. **Run validation**: `node validate-vercel.js`

## 🆘 IF STILL BLOCKED

If SSO cannot be disabled, we have backup options:
- **Deploy to Render**: `./deploy-render.sh`
- **Deploy to Netlify**: `./deploy-netlify.sh`

## 📞 NEED HELP?

If you can't find the settings:
1. Share a screenshot of your Vercel project settings
2. Check if you're the project owner
3. Verify your account type (personal vs team)
