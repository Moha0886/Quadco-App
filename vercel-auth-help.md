# Vercel Authentication Issue Resolution

## Problem
Vercel is intercepting all API requests with SSO (Single Sign-On) authentication, returning HTML login pages instead of allowing our custom authentication to work.

## Evidence
- All API endpoints return 401 with HTML authentication page
- Response includes `_vercel_sso_nonce` cookie indicating SSO is active
- Header: `x-robots-tag: noindex` suggests protection is enabled

## Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Added `"public": true` to vercel.json
2. ✅ Removed and recreated the project
3. ✅ Updated middleware to exclude public routes
4. ❌ Function runtime configurations caused errors
5. ❌ Custom routing configurations conflicted with Next.js

## Current Status
- New project URL: https://quadco-fo3uuz1xo-moha0886s-projects.vercel.app
- Same SSO protection issue persists
- Authentication appears to be at account/team level

## Next Steps
1. **Check Vercel Dashboard Settings:**
   - Go to Account/Team settings
   - Look for "Security" or "Authentication" section
   - Disable SSO/Password Protection if enabled

2. **Alternative Deployment Options:**
   - Deploy to different hosting (Railway, Render, DigitalOcean)
   - Use Vercel with a different account
   - Contact Vercel support to disable team-level authentication

3. **Potential Workarounds:**
   - Add authorized domains/IPs
   - Use Vercel Enterprise features if available
   - Create API-only subdomain

## Database Status
✅ PostgreSQL database is properly configured and seeded
✅ Local development works correctly
✅ All application code is ready for production

The only blocker is Vercel's account-level authentication protection.
